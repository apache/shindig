-Welcome to Apache Shindig!
+                          Apache Shindig PHP
 
-* Read javascript/README for instructions for using the Shindig Gadget
-  Container JavaScript to enable your page to render Gadgets.
-* Read the instructions below for how to use PHP Shindig
-* For more information, see http://incubator.apache.org/shindig/
+  What is it?
+  -----------
 
+  Shindig is a JavaScript container and implementations of the backend APIs
+  and proxy required for hosting OpenSocial applications.
 
-Installing and Running The PHP Shindig Gadget Server
-============================================
+  This is the PHP implementation of Shindig. If you are looking to the Java 
+  implementation, please visit our website.
 
-Prequisites before building Shindig for PHP
-============================================
-In order to build and run Shindig for PHP, you must have the following:
+  Documentation
+  -------------
 
-- A Subversion client installed in order to checkout the code.
-  Instructions for downloading and installing Subversion can be found here:
-  http://subversion.tigris.org/
-- Apache with mod_rewrite enabled.
-- PHP 5.2.x with the json, simplexml, mcrypt and curl extentions enabled.
+  The most up-to-date documentation can be found at http://incubator.apache.org/shindig/
+  and at http://incubator.apache.org/shindig/developers/php/index.html 
+  for specific PHP documentation.
 
+  Read javascript/README for instructions for using the Shindig Gadget 
+  Container JavaScript to enable your page to render Gadgets.
 
-Getting the code (if you're running from svn and not a release tarball)
-============================================
-Create a subdirectory in your web document root, e.g. /var/www/html and
-checkout the Shindig code from its Subversion repository
+  Release Notes
+  -------------
 
-mkdir /var/www/html/shindig
-cd /var/www/html/shindig
-svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shindig/trunk/ .
+  The full list of changes can be found at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHINDIG.
 
+  System Requirements
+  -------------------
 
-Running Shindig from a release download
-============================================
+  PHP:
+    5.2.x or above with the json, simplexml, mcrypt and curl extentions 
+    enabled.
+  Web server:
+    Apache with mod_rewrite enabled.
+  Memory:
+    No minimum requirement.
+  Disk:
+    No minimum requirement. 
+  Operating System:
+    No minimum requirement. On Windows, Windows NT and above or Cygwin is 
+    required for the startup scripts. Tested on Windows XP, Fedora Core 
+    and Mac OS X.
 
-The instructions are identical as when running from an svn checkout, except
-that the /shindig/php directory in the virtual host becomes just /shindig, ie:
+  Installing Shindig
+  ------------------
 
-	<VirtualHost your_ip:your_port>
-	       ServerName your.host
-	       DocumentRoot /var/www/html/shindig
-	       ... other normal settings in vhosts...
-		<Directory />
-			AllowOverride All
-		</Directory>
-	</VirtualHost>
+  Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. shindig-1.0-incubating-php.zip to 
+  the web document root, e.g. /var/www/html. 
 
-Running Shindig from an svn checkout
-============================================
-With PHP There is no need to build anything - the source code
-is already built.
-
-To run the code, you have several options:
+  Rename the created shindig-1.0-incubating-php dir to shindig. 
 
 a. Create a new virtual host
 
-Point your apache to the php dir with a virtual host like:
+  Point your Apache to the shindig dir with a virtual host like:
 
 	<VirtualHost your_ip:your_port>
 	       ServerName your.host
-	       DocumentRoot /var/www/html/shindig/php
+         DocumentRoot /var/www/html/shindig
 	       ... other normal settings in vhosts...
-		<Directory />
+    <Directory>
 			AllowOverride All
 		</Directory>
 	</VirtualHost>
 	
-
 Restart apache, and point your browser to:
 
 http://<your.host>/gadgets/ifr?url=http://www.labpixies.com/campaigns/todo/todo.xml
 
-you should see something like this:
-http://shindig.chabotc.com/gadgets/ifr?url=http://www.labpixies.com/campaigns/todo/todo.xml
-
 b. Run with an existing host
 
-If you cannot/don't want to create a virtual host, you can edit the file php/config/container.php
-or php/config/local.php (see the comments php/config/container.php for documentation of the
-configuration system) and change the web_prefix setting to '/shindig/php'.
+  If you cannot/don't want to create a virtual host, you can edit the file 
+  php/config/container.php or php/config/local.php (see the comments 
+  php/config/container.php for documentation of the configuration system) 
+  and change the web_prefix setting to '/shindig/php'.
 
 In this case, you should also change all paths in shindig/config/container.js
 (see the comments there for documentation of the JSON configuration system).
