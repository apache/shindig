To have working oauth & signed requests you need a private and public key.

You can generate these using the 'openssl' command by doing the following:

Goto the certs directory:
# cd shindig/php/certs

Generate the private key:
# openssl genrsa -out private.key -des3 1024

Enter a pass phrase, and make sure to put this in 'private_key_phrase' in 
config/container.php

Generate the public key:
# openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key private.key > public.crt

Enter the pass phrase again, and your host's information
