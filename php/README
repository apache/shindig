Installing and Running The PHP Shindig Gadget Server
============================================

1) Make sure you have PHP 5.x installed and have the simplexml and json extentions enabled; It also
   requires apache with .htaccess and mod_rewrite support

2) Copy the files to your web root, and edit the config.php web_prefix and debug settings
   to your liking. Make sure that the features and javascript directories are also copied
   or edit your config.php to reflect their location. If you change the web_prefix also
   update the container/container.js file too point to the correct locations

3) Hit server at http://<yourhost>/gadgets/ifr?url=<gadget-url>
   Example: http://<yourhost>/gadgets/ifr?url=http://www.labpixies.com/campaigns/todo/todo.xml
   Or hit the sample container at http://<yourhost>/gadgets/files/samplecontainer/samplecontainer.html

The PHP source of the gadget server resides in the gadgets, socialdata and common directories.
