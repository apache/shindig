Running:
  Use Apache and mod_proxy with bcmath enabled pointed at this directory

How It Works:
  # Basic configuration is in the config.php. Set up the gadget, the
    host domain, and the domain to use for proxy calls there.
  # index.php loads comframe.php in an iframe
  # comframe.php creates a XARK (Cross Application Request Token) and then
    loads container.php in an iframe, passing in the XARK
  # container.php validates the XARK and loads the module, sets up the 
    javascript container, and loads the gadget, rendering the gadget as its
    output.
  # Javascript API calls presently do not work
  
  The double iframe is to allow for inter-iframe communication, presently
  specialized for just adjusting iframe height.
  
  This implementation is basically a prototype, not a fully functioning
  implementation. Hopefully it can help get things moving towards a fully
  functioning server, though!

Major TODO Items:
* Replace RSA.class.php with OpenSSL
* Support Profiles
* Support Friends
* Support Persistence
* Support Activity Stream
* Switch over to the Shindig Javascript
* Support OpenSocial 0.6
* Documentation
* Support proxied API requests (makeRequest)
