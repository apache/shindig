You can automatically include new features into your shindig server by adding
them to this directory. Features should exist in a self-contained directory
with the following structure:

features
  |_your-feature-name
   |_feature.xml
   |_code-to-run-inside-gadget.js
   |_code-to-run-inside-container.js

The structure of feature.xml is as follows:
TODO: link to xml schema for feature.xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<feature>
  <name>your-feature-name (required)</name>
  <dependency>any dependency you have (optional, may have multiple)</dependency>
  <gadget> (optional)
    <script src="code-to-run-inside-gadget.js"/> (optional, may have multiple,
        may use web resources as well but we strongly encourage bundling your
        javascript with the xml)
  </gadget>
  <container> (optional)
    <script src="code-to-run-inside-container.js"> (same as for <gadget>)
  </container>
</feature>

Please always make sure that all files you provide are encoded as utf8.

When adding new features, your javascript should conform to shindig javascript
coding conventions. This means that you should not be producing new globals and
your feature should be compatible with Caja.

When committing a new feature, you should update the features.txt file by
running the following script in a unix-like environment:

ls -R1a features/**/*.xml > features/features.txt

environments.
