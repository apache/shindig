  <!-- 
    jsondom (Read Only DOM) is implemented in both JavaScript
    and server-side code. Its JavaScript-only implementation
    provides a DOM parser that uses underlying browser objects.
    This is, however, not Caja-compatible.

    Therefore a server-side DOM-to-JSON parser mode is provided
    to support this use case, where either explicitly required
    (Caja context) or otherwise directly requested.
