Installing and running both servers
============================================

In order to use the samplecontainer you will need to have both the gadget 
rendering server and the social data server running under the same url path. 
The easiest way to do this is to build the java/server package:

1) Install Maven 2.0 (see http://maven.apache.org)

2) Make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the location of your
   JDK/JRE, and that the maven executable is in your PATH.

3) From java/...
  * mvn package - Builds all of the java classes and runs tests. Useful also when you 
    need first to obtain an export sources-jar, e.g. for remote debugging with Eclipse.
  
3) From java/server/...
   * mvn jetty:run-war - Builds both servers and installs servlet at localhost:8080.
     - To run on a different port, use: mvn -Djetty.port=<port> jetty:run-war

4) Hit server at http://localhost:<port>/gadgets/files/samplecontainer/samplecontainer.html
