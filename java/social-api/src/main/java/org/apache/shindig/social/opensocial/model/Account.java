 * person that the account is connected to, and consumers are appropriately warned of this in the
 * Specification.

 * contain a non-empty value for either username or userid, and MAY contain both, in which case the
 * two values MUST be for the same account. These accounts can be used to determine if a user on one
 * service is also known to be the same person on a different service, to facilitate connecting to
 * people the user already knows on different services.
