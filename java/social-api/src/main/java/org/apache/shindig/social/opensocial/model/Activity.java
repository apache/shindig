/**
 * see http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/docs/0.8/reference/#opensocial.Activity.Field for all
 * field meanings. All fields are represented in the js api at this time except for lastUpdated.
 * This field is currently only in the RESTful spec.
 *
 * <p>
 * Representation of an activity.
 * <p>
 * </p>
 * Activities are rendered with a title and an optional activity body.
 * <p>
 * </p>
 * You may set the title and body directly as strings when calling opensocial.newActivity. However,
 * it is usually beneficial to create activities using Message Templates for the title and body.
 * <p>
 * </p>
 * Users will have many activities in their activity streams, and containers will not show every
 * activity that is visible to a user. To help display large numbers of activities, containers will
 * summarize a list of activities from a given source to a single entry.
 * <p>
 * </p>
 * You can provide Activity Summaries to customize the text shown when multiple activities are
 * summarized. If no customization is provided, a container may ignore your activities altogether or
 * provide default text such as "Bob changed his status message + 20 other events like this."
 * <ul>
 * <li> Activity Summaries will always summarize around a specific key in a key/value pair. This is
 * so that the summary can say something concrete (this is clearer in the example below). </li>
 * <li> Other variables will have synthetic "Count" variables created with the total number of items
 * summarized. </li>
 * <li> Message ID of the summary is the message ID of the main template + ":" + the data key </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <code><pre>
 * &lt;messagebundle&gt;
 *  &lt;msg name=&quot;LISTEN_TO_THIS_SONG:Artist&quot;&gt;
 *    ${Subject.Count} of your friends have suggested listening to songs
 *    by ${Artist}!
 *  &lt;/msg&gt;
 *  &lt;msg name=&quot;LISTEN_TO_THIS_SONG:Song&quot;&gt;
 *    ${Subject.Count} of your friends have suggested listening to ${Song}
 *  !&lt;/msg&gt;
 *  &lt;msg name=&quot;LISTEN_TO_THIS_SONG:Subject&quot;&gt;
 *   ${Subject.DisplayName} has recommended ${Song.Count} songs to you.
 *  &lt;/msg&gt;
 *  &lt;/messagebundle&gt;
