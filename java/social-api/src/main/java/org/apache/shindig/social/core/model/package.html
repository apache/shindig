<h1>Core Social Model</h1>
<p>Default implementations of the Social Model. Implementors my want
to extend these classes, however the rest of the code should not bind
directly to these classes, but should bind to the interfaces in
o.a.s.social.opensocial.model, if this is observed, then implementors
will also be free to provide their own implementations of the the model
interfaces.</p>
