There are four parts to the java gadget servers:

* java/common The common java code that both the social data server and the
  gadget rendering server rely on.

* java/gadgets This server is used for rendering gadgets.

* java/social-api This server is used to provide social data for gadgets. Long
  term, it will implement the OpenSocial RESTful apis.

* java/server This directory only contains a pom and a web.xml file. It is used
  to run both the gadget rendering code and the social data code at once. In
  order to use the samplecontainer you must run this server.
