/**
 * Base interface providing Gadget Server's primary extensibility mechanism.
 *
 * During processing of a {@code Gadget}, a tree of {@code GadgetFeature}
 * objects is constructed based on the &lt;Require&gt; and &lt;Optional&gt;
 * tags declared in its {@code GadgetSpec}, and the dependencies registered
 * for these in {@code GadgetFeatureRegistry}.
 *
 * Each {@code GadgetFeature}'s process method is called - potentially
 * in parallel with many others whose dependencies have also been satisfied.
 *
 * To extend the Gadget Server's feature set, simply implement this interface
 * and register your class with {@code GadgetFeatureRegistry}, indicating
 * which other {@code GadgetFeature} features are needed before yours can
 * operate successfully.
 *
 * Each feature <i>must</i> be instantiable by a no-argument constructor,
 * and will <i>always</i> be instantiated this way. As such, it is recommended
 * not to define a constructor for a feature at all.
