Installing and Running Shindig Gadget Server
============================================

1) Install Maven 2.0 (see http://maven.apache.org)

2) Make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the location of your
   JDK/JRE, and that the maven executable is in your PATH.

3) From java/...
  * mvn package - Builds all of the java classes including the Gadget Server and runs 
    tests. Useful also when you need first to obtain an export sources-jar, 
    e.g. for remote debugging with Eclipse.
  
3) From java/gadgets/...
   * mvn jetty:run - Builds Gadget Server (no tests), installs Servlet at localhost:8080.
     - To run on a different port, use: mvn -Djetty.port=<port> jetty:run
   * mvn jetty:run-war - If you want to use any of the sample files you need to run 
     in this mode. Also, mvn jetty:run-exploded can work. 

4) Hit server at http://localhost:<port>/gadgets/ifr?url=<gadget-url>
   Example: http://localhost:<port>/gadgets/ifr?url=http://www.labpixies.com/campaigns/todo/todo.xml
