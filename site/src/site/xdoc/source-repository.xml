    <section name="Source Repository">
      <p>
        Apache Shindig projects use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> to manage their source code.
        Instructions on Subversion use can be found in the online book
        <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with Subversion</a>.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Web Access">
        <p>
          The following list shows the links to the online source repositories for the various versions of Apache Shindig:
        </p>
        <source>
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shindig/trunk/">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shindig/trunk/</a>
</source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Anonymous Access">
        <p>
          The source can be checked out anonymously from SVN with one of these commands depending on the development
          line you are looking for:
        </p>
        <source>$ svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shindig/trunk/ shindig</source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Developer Access">
        <p>
          Everyone can access the Subversion repository via HTTP, but committers must checkout the Subversion
          repository via HTTPS to gain write access:
        </p>
        <source>$ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shindig/trunk/ shindig</source>
        <p>
          To commit changes to the repository, execute the following command to commit your changes (<code>svn</code> will
          prompt you for your password):
        </p>
        <source>
$ svn commit --username your-username -m "A message"</source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Access from behind a Firewall">
        <p>
          For those users who are stuck behind a corporate firewall which is blocking HTTP access to the Subversion
          repository, you can try to access it via the developer connection:
        </p>
        <source>$ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shindig/trunk/ shindig</source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Access through a Proxy">
        <p>
          The Subversion client can go through a proxy, if you configure it to do so. First, edit your <code>servers</code>
          configuration file to indicate which proxy to use. The file's location depends on your operating system. On
          Linux or Unix it is located in the directory <code>~/.subversion</code>. On Windows it is in <code>%APPDATA%\Subversion</code>
          (try <code>echo %APPDATA%</code>, note this is a hidden directory).
        </p>
        <p>
          There are comments in the file explaining what to do. If you don't have that file, get the latest Subversion
          client and run any command; this will cause the configuration directory and template files to be created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: Edit the <code>servers</code> file and add something like:
        </p>
        <source>
[global]
http-proxy-host = your.proxy.name
http-proxy-port = 3128</source>
