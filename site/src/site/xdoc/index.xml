      <p> Shindig is an OpenSocial container and helps you to start hosting OpenSocial apps
        quickly by providing the code to render gadgets, proxy requests, and handle REST and
        RPC requests.</p>

      <p> Shindig's goal is to allow new sites to start hosting social apps in under an hour's
        worth of work.</p>

      <p>Shindig is a container for hosting social application consisting of four parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Gadget Container JavaScript</b>: core JavaScript foundation for general
          gadget functionality (<a
            href="http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/dev_guide.html">read more
            about gadget functionality</a>). This JavaScript manages security,
          communication, UI layout, and feature extensions, such as the OpenSocial API.</li>
        <li><b>Gadget Rendering Server</b>: used to render the gadget XML into JavaScript
          and HTML for the container to expose via the container JavaScript.</li>
        <li><b>OpenSocial Container JavaScript</b>: JavaScript environment that sits on top
          of the Gadget Container JavaScript and provides OpenSocial specific
          functionality (profiles, friends, activities, datastore).</li>
        <li><b>OpenSocial Data Server</b>: an implementation of the server interface to
          container-specific information, including the OpenSocial REST APIs, with clear
          extension points so others can connect it to their own backends.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shindig is the reference implementation of <a
          href="http://www.opensocial.org/page/specs-1"> OpenSocial API
        specifications</a>, a standard set of Social Network APIs which includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Profiles</li>
        <li>Relationships</li>
        <li>Activities</li>
        <li>Shared applications</li>
        <li>Authentication</li>
        <li>Authorization</li>
      </ul>
