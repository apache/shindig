/**
 * API to assist with management of the OAuth popup window.
 *
 * MAKE A COPY OF THIS FILE.  Do not hot link to it.
 *
 * Expected usage:
 *
 * 1) Gadget attempts to fetch OAuth data for the user and discovers that
 * approval is needed.  The gadget creates two new UI elements:
 *
 *   - a "personalize this gadget" button or link
 *   - a "personalization done" button or link, which is initially hidden.
 *
 * With any luck, the user will never need to click the "personalization done"
 * button, but it should be created and displayed in case we can't
 * automatically detect when the user has approved access to their gadget.
 *
 * 2) Gadget creates a popup object and associates event handlers with the UI
 * elements:
 *  
 *    var popup = shindig.oauth.popup({
 *        destination: response.oauthApprovalUrl,
 *        windowOptions: "height=300,width=200",
 *        onOpen: function() { 
 *          $("personalizeDone").style.display = "block"
 *        },
 *        onClose: function() {
 *          $("personalizeDone").style.display = "none"
 *          $("personalizeDone").style.display = "none"
 *          fetchData();
 *        }
 *    });
 *
 *    personalizeButton.onclick = popup.createOpenerOnClick();
 *    personalizeDoneButton.onclick = popup.createApprovedOnClick();
 *
 * 3) When the user clicks the personalization button/link, a window is opened
 *    to the approval URL.
 *
 * 4) When the window is closed, the oauth popup calls the onClose function
 *    and the gadget attempts to fetch the user's data.
